If you're starting a brand new project, this won't take long at all. However, if you're converting a Windows platform project to an Android platform project, you will have to convert your assets appropriately. This can take quite a while for larger projects.

For more details on best practices when working with dual-platform projects, read our documentation on [Cross-Platform Setup](/platforms/android/cross-platform-setup).

## 3 Steps to get your world on VRChat for Quest

### 1. Open Your Build Settings

You can access your [Build Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettings.html) from Unity's main menu by going to "File" -> "Build Settings". Or you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B`.

### 2. Switch Platform to Android

:::caution Requires Additional Setup
If the Android option isn't appearing, [you need to install Unity's Android SDK.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-sdksetup.html)

:::

Click "Android" -> "Switch Platform". Unity will reimport your assets for Android. This will take a while for larger projects with many assets.

### 3. Publish -> New Build

That's it! Your content is now available on Quest! Note that you must **upload** your content to test it. You can't use the SDK's "Build and Test" feature for Android content.
